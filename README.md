# Advent of Code 2018
Following along with Advent of Code 2018. I am starting this very late so I am not sure if I will catch up or not. Last year I started this and I tried to use a different language every day. This year I am sticking with Ruby to prepare me for a new position I am taking in the new year. Each day has two parts and both will exist as separate ruby files.

## Calendar
Day 1 - Completed!

Day 2 - Completed!


## Note about performance
Unless a performance metric is explicitly set, my approach for these tasks is to get my code working fast and worry less about performance and edge cases. Essentially my code is just finding the answer to the exact problem without accounting for every possible scenario.

Happy Coding!
